This repository contains a word document that is the reflection and 2 folders.

The MIPS folder has 3 MIPS programs.
A program to find the sum of 1 though N where N is entered by the user.
A program to find the factorial of N where N is entered by the user.
A program to count the number of 0's in the binary representation of a number.

The Lex&Yacc folder contains 2 files.
Test.l and test.y
These files are based on the music example given to us.
The lex file tries to use only a regex expression to make a program that can accept grade values and store the.
While the regex value is found and the print works the arithmetic part still needs work.
The Yacc file is an unedited version of Professor Chuang's music.y file. This is because I do not think it needs to be edited for the regex only attempt.
